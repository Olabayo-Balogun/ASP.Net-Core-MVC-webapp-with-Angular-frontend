@*Creating the "_ViewStart" page is by default the base page, which why it makes sense to declare the layout page here, all the pages will automatically inherit what is here.*@
@*The Razor View Start page scaffolds this page and adds the "_Layout" page by default when you right-click the "Views" folder and "add new item".*@

    Layout = "_Layout";
