@*This is used to add things (majoryly C# declarations) that will be used on every page*@
@*Note that this "_ViewImports" page as well as "_ViewStart" file needs to be present in every folder containing view pages for the declarations in it to take effect.*@
@*For example, the "Pages" folder has a couple view pages, none of them will implement any declaration in the "_ViewImports" and "_ViewStart" page until a copy of these pages are within the "Pages" folder*@
@using DutchTreat.Controllers

@*The "@using DutchTreat.ViewModels" helps ensure that the view models in the "ViewModels" file can be declared in any page without having to use the full namespace in that razor page*@
